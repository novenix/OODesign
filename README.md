In the class diaram you can seea main class that is App.java, that uses PhyClass and LocClass.

**LinkedList**
Is the repersentation of the linked list, you can send any kind of object

**LinkedListNode**
Represents the position of the list, or tthe node

allows get the standart deviation of the linkedlist, it needs to use the Mean class
**Mean**
allows get the mean of the linkedlist

**App**
- is the main app class
